Project name
Expense Management System

Problem statement (2–3 paragraphs, plain English)
Employees currently submit business expenses using multiple formats such as spreadsheets, emails, and receipt attachments. This results in inconsistent information, missing details, and a lack of standardization. The finance team must manually review and validate each submission, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

Due to these inconsistencies, the business struggles to accurately track employee expenses. Incomplete information and unclear approval history make auditing difficult, and in some cases expenses are approved more than once. This creates financial risk, reduces visibility into spending, and makes it harder for the company to maintain accurate records.

Who this system is for
this system is used by,
Employee: who enters the information of expenses they made for business like meetings, food, travel, etc...
Manager: Who approves/ rejects the information.
Finance team: who validates the receipts

What this system does (scope)
Employees should be able to submit expenses digitally.
Finance should be able to review, and validate them.
Managers should be able to approve/ reject and have visibility into expenses under their team.

What this system does NOT do (non-goals)
Payment processing
Tax calculation
Integration with accounting software
